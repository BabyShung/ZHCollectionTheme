Ghost theme for my website: http://www.babyshung.com

#Modules need to set up manually

1.Turn on the Labs feature

In your admin page, go to 'Labs' and turn on features 'Public API' and 'Subscribers'

2.About me setup

If you have a post for 'About me', just turn it into a static page in the post 'Post Settings' and also set the 'Post URL' to 'about'.

If you don't, just create a post and do the above steps.

3.Blog

You need to set up the below before you go to http://[yourSite]/blog

Since the page for showing all the posts is not in the index.has, I moved it to a static page.

We just need to create a new post and turn it to a static page in the post 'Post Settings' and set the 'Post URL' to 'blog'.

4.BookList There is actually a booklist section. What you want to do first is to make sure you included dashboard_books.hbs in index.hbs. And when you create your first "book" post, add a new tag "Booklist".

#Others In the index.hbs, you can arrange the dashboard cards based on what you need.

In the nav_bar.hbs, you can customize what icons you want to show.
